3073	3535	PHOTO: President-Elect Trump Grabs Pussy at the White House	Mac Slavo	"It seems that President-elect Donald Trump is back to business as usual, doing what he does best.
No wonder things are off to such a tumultuous start. I’m sure there’ll be much more where this came from.
H/t Thanks to our commenter FTW for the great meme:
President-Elect Trump Publicly Grabs Pussy at the White House 

On a more serious note, it certainly seems that they’ve become fast friends.
Despite a lot of campaign rhetoric on both sides of this coin, it seems that President Obama and President-elect Trump are willing and ready to work together in the great transition. It’s par for the course, as Obama, in turn got pretty cozy with the Bushes on his way in the door as well.
Will “draining the swamp” be possible if Trump plays nice with the outgoing establishment and his campaign rivals?
That remains to be seen, but Paul Craig Roberts issued a stark warning to pay careful attention to the advisors and appointments that Trump chooses in the next few months, because these little known individuals will determine who really runs his administration, and much of what kind of presidency it will be.
Let’s hope Trump exercises great wisdom, because there will be a lot of pressure on him to accept plenty of deeply-entrenched political operatives working inside the deep state (and irrespective of political parties).

The Delhi Police have arrested an 18-year old boy, Samarth Sanghi, on charges of creating panic and endangering public safety. The arrest occurred after Sanghi inadvertently ended up dispersing a long ATM queue by flashing his Samsung Galaxy Note 7. ( Image via intoday.in ) 
Sam Sang, as he is colloquially known, was petrified during his police interrogation. “I have no idea what’s going on. I was waiting at this long ATM queue at Khan Market and out of sheer boredom, I decided to take a selfie with my Samsung Galaxy Note 7. I signaled to those gathered to pose for my selfie, but the moment they saw the device, they let out loud shrieks and ran helter skelter and a mini-stampede ensued. Some even screamed ‘ Bhaago!’ . (Escape!) I was stunned to see the queue vanish. I coolly walked into the unguarded ATM and drew my 2000 bucks for the day. The next thing I know, the Delhi police are at my doorstep and here I am, all locked up,” a teary-eyed Sanghi sobbed to The UnReal Times . 
Sang, however, was soon visited by Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who carried his own Note 7 to the police station. “ Mere paas sirf aloo ki factory nahin, Note 7 ki factory bhi hai! Mujhe bhi giraftaar kar lo bhaiya !” ( Not only do I have a potato factory, but also a Note 7 factory. Arrest me too! ) the Nehru-Gandhi scion thundered squealed, rolling his sleeves up. “If we empower the villages, we can wipe out Note 7s in 7 minutes,” Gandhi added. 
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tore into PM Modi and Lt. Gov Najeeb Jung over Sang’s arrest. “As it is, the psychopath Modi has full control over the Delhi thullas . The whole world knows about the LG vs Samsung rivalry, so it’s no surprise that our LG has taken special interest in this case and asked the thullas to arrest Sang. Modi ji , if you have the guts, arrest me! Yeh Kejriwal aapse darne wala nahi !” (this Kejriwal isn’t scared of you!) the AAP chief bellowed. 
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley voiced his concerns over the incident in an exclusive interview to NDTV’s Barkha Dutt. “Barkha, I appeal to the people of the country to avoid the inadvertent sabotaging of what could be a historic, pervasively successful scheme. Coming to the specifics of this case, I would urge all my fellow citizens of this great nation, in possession of Note 7s to switch them off before arriving at the ATM queues, taking into consideration, the larger public interest. Failure to do so will have me introduce a new Note7 Cess and impose it among the device owners,” the Finance Minister winked. 
The final word, however, went to the PM Modi himself. “NOTE stands for Nefarious, Outrageously Threatening Explosive,” the PM tweeted. Tweet About Ashwin Kumar

5355	6112	Rallying in North Carolina, Donald Trump Formally Introduces James Mattis - The New York Times	Michael D. Shear	FAYETTEVILLE, N. C.  —     Donald J. Trump formally introduced Gen. James N. Mattis as his choice for defense secretary Tuesday night, appearing side by side with him during a   “thank you” rally in this heavily military community, home to the Army Special Operations Command and the 82nd Airborne Division. To a roar in the Crown Coliseum, Mr. Trump called General Mattis “one of the most effective generals that we’ve had in many, many decades” and the living embodiment of the Marine Corps motto, “semper fidelis. ” He vowed that with General Mattis, nicknamed Mad Dog, leading the Pentagon, America would rebuild its military. “Mad Dog plays no games, right?” Mr. Trump asked the cheering crowd. The rally was the second of several large events that Mr. Trump is holding before his inauguration next month. In Cincinnati last week, he reprised the brash and biting tone of his presidential campaign and boasted about his victory over Hillary Clinton. But for North Carolinians hoping to see that performance again, Mr. Trump was more restrained. He followed the teleprompter, recapping the agenda he intends to pursue in office, including repealing the Affordable Care Act, stopping illegal immigration, renegotiating trade deals and bringing jobs back to the country from overseas. He barely lashed out at the news media, as he usually does, but he did brag about winning North Carolina, a state that political pundits had repeatedly predicted would support Mrs. Clinton. The location of the rally  —   a stadium not far from Fort Bragg, a vast military base housing more than 50, 000 personnel  —   gave Mr. Trump an opportunity to emphasize his support for the armed forces and to lavish praise upon General Mattis, whom he has compared favorably to Gen. George S. Patton, the famed World War II officer. For the first 15 minutes of his address, Mr. Trump outlined his approach to foreign policy, saying he would “engage the use of military forces when it’s in the vital national security interests of the United States. ” He promised to make the military stronger than it has ever been, but said that under his leadership, the country would “stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about. ” “This destructive cycle of intervention and chaos must finally come to an end,” he said. The   offered few details about how his approach would play out, though he said he would quickly move to eliminate the automatic military spending cuts that Congress and President Obama reluctantly embraced several years ago to control spending and reduce the deficit. He also suggested that the United States would seek to strengthen alliances around the world that help prevent conflicts. “Any nation that shares these goals will be our partner in this mission,” he said. The crowd cheered Mr. Trump when he vowed to improve health care for the nation’s veterans. “It will be the duty of my administration to make sure we protect those who protect us,” he said. Even before he takes office, Mr. Trump, who said once during the campaign that he knew more than the nation’s generals, is seizing the opportunity to assume the mantle of commander in chief. On Saturday, he is planning to attend the annual   football game, a tradition often observed by the sitting occupant of the White House. A spokesman said Mr. Trump, like the presidents before him, would sit in the stands on both sides during the game, which is the annual pinnacle of a fierce rivalry. Mr. Trump began the rally by inviting General Mattis onto the stage, where the general expressed gratitude for the chance to serve again and said he hoped Congress would give him the waiver he needs to be the Pentagon’s civilian leader. He retired from the Marines in 2013, and federal law requires a   waiting period between active duty and serving as defense secretary. “You’ll get that waiver, right?” Mr. Trump said when he came back to the microphone. “If you didn’t get that waiver, there will be such a lot of angry people. ” Republicans in Congress moved on Tuesday to use a stopgap spending bill to pave the way for General Mattis to receive the waiver. The spending measure, which was unveiled Tuesday night and must be approved by Friday to avoid a government shutdown, contains language that would speed up the consideration of legislation granting the waiver early next year. On the same day that Mr. Trump focused on the military in North Carolina, Mr. Obama traveled to Tampa, Fla. where he thanked service members at MacDill Air Force Base and delivered a speech on his administration’s approach to counterterrorism. For Mr. Trump, the visit to Fayetteville was a triumphant return to a state that was critical to his election victory and that the Clinton campaign had thought it could win. While he did not spend much time Tuesday night reliving his win, Mr. Trump could hardly resist going off script to get a few cheers. “We won Ohio. We won Iowa by a massive number, 10 points,” he said. “Then we went down and we won Florida. ‘We have breaking news: Donald Trump wins Florida. Donald Trump wins North Carolina. ’” That brought a roar from the crowd, and Mr. Trump added: “We won so many states. We won 30 states, 32 states. We won so much, and we just kept winning. ” The   is scheduled to keep traveling in the days ahead. He will hold a rally in Des Moines on Thursday and will go to Grand Rapids, Mich. on Friday. More rallies are possible in the coming weeks, officials said. Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign is paying for the rallies, according to a spokesman for the transition. Campaign experts said that was allowed, and that candidates often used campaign funds to pay for events that took place between the election and inauguration.	0	FAYETTEVILLE , N.

9743	11089	At Donald Trump’s Properties, a Showcase for a Brand and a President-Elect - The New York Times	Jeremy W. Peters	They stood in line at Trump Tower, sometimes up to half an hour, handing over their cash for mementos of the  : mini,   chocolate bricks stamped “Trump. ” Trump monogrammed sweaters, towels and glassware. Trump cologne. “I bought it for my two sons,” said Shanon Loggins, 47, of Lufkin, Tex. showing off a golden shopping bag embossed with the Trump crest that carried two bottles of Success by Trump, a fragrance for men. “They need to be successful,” she explained. Business is good for Donald J. Trump. People are flocking to his Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, dining in his restaurants and buying his wares. Reporters are fastidiously chronicling the comings and goings of his transition team, his   properties providing the backdrop for television live shots. Mr. Trump has taken the staid task of preparing to assume the presidency and turned it into an exercise in conspicuous   and carefully choreographed branding. But as the   makes use of his vast real estate holdings, he is also raising questions about whether he is exploiting the high profile and stature of the office to conduct what could be seen as a promotional tour for the Trump Organization. The venues he has picked to conduct his official transition planning attest to his success as a real estate developer: Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper where he lives and works amid   eateries and boutiques    the upscale, private Palm Beach, Fla. club where he has chosen to hold meetings over Thanksgiving and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Mr. Trump especially liked the Bedminster setting, he told his aides, because the images of him receiving potential cabinet appointees at the front door of the clubhouse resembled 10 Downing Street in London. In planning future transition meetings, Mr. Trump and his team are considering other properties of his that might fit his desire for rich, regal symbolism. “It stinks,” said Norman Eisen, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama from 2009 to 2011. Because there is no specific law prohibiting public officeholders from financially beneficial   what Mr. Trump is doing is probably not illegal, Mr. Eisen added. “But that doesn’t make it right,” he said. “It’s part and parcel of the unsavory marketing of his brands that he also did during the campaign. ” Unsavory or not, it is all part of the stagecraft and spectacle that Mr. Trump has directed from his   office in Trump Tower  —   all of which is being ravenously consumed by the news media and his loyal followers. Most days since Mr. Trump became the   the lobby of Trump Tower has been a public staging area for aspects of the transition that Mr. Trump most wants people to see. Potential cabinet appointees march across its buffed marble floors, past the cameras that stream the scene live to   and into the gold mirrored elevators. This week there were people like Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, who disparaged Mr. Trump as “a cancer on conservatism” when they were battling for the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump and his staff have even devised a proper greeting protocol for arriving guests. As Mr. Perry made his way through the lobby on Monday, a young woman looped her arm around his and escorted him past the cameras. The same woman was also on hand over the weekend to accompany visiting guests when Mr. Trump moved the meetings to Bedminster. The golf club was even more of a display of munificence, with Mr. Trump turning to the cameras to embrace Mitt Romney, who just months ago condemned Mr. Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud. ” He is now a leading candidate for secretary of state. There were more ethnically diverse potential cabinet candidates there, as well, like T. W. Shannon, the first   speaker of the Oklahoma House, and Michelle Rhee, a former schools chancellor in Washington, who is  . When Mr. Trump was done interviewing them, he would see them off outside and, once again, banter with the news media. “Tremendous talent  —   we’re seeing tremendous talent,” Mr. Trump said on Saturday. “People that, as I say, we will ‘make America great again.’ These are really great people. These are really, really talented people. ” As the cameras rolled during the weekend at Bedminster, temperatures dropped sharply, sending journalists into the gift shop, where the only   attire they could find was a winter hat with Trump embroidered on it. The market for anything stamped Trump has been bustling. At the gift kiosk on the lower level of Trump Tower  —   between the Trump Ice Cream Parlor and the Trump Grill, with its $25 prix fixe lunch  —   the line on Monday morning was about two dozen people deep. Cashiers were doing their civic diligence, asking anyone purchasing Trump campaign gear like the “Make America Great Again” hats ($25) whether they were American citizens. (Law prohibits foreigners from giving money to campaigns.) Marilyn Bryan, 70, of Terre Haute, Ind. was sitting at a table outside the kiosk with her daughter Trisha. In May, Ms. Bryan was at a Trump rally in her hometown when someone passed out next to her, knocked her down and broke her femur. That might have been enough Trump for anyone else. But she decided that as long as she was visiting New York this week, she might as well stop by the tower to take in the scene. “What’d we spend? $200?” she asked her daughter. Inside her shopping bag were a hat, the golden Trump chocolate bars and some other Trump knickknacks she planned to give to her relatives. The chocolate, they were somewhat disappointed to learn, was actually made in Fort Wayne, Ind. Standing nearby were Paul and Lea Foster of Hidden Hills, Calif. After purchasing two hats and two   Ms. Foster, 62, marveled at Mr. Trump’s ability to cash in on his name. “He’s sure figured out how to make money,” she said. Her husband nodded. “He’s a businessman, a promoter,” said Mr. Foster, 81. “Let’s hope he knows how to run the country. ”	0	stood line Trump Tower , half hour , handing cash mementos   : mini ,    chocolate bricks stamped “ Trump . ” Trump monogrammed sweaters , towels glassware .

9824	11175	Maoists for Trump? In China, Fans Admire His Nationalist Views - The New York Times	Chris Buckley	BEIJING  —   They protest, picket and sing to defend Mao’s memory, yearning for the East to be red again. But lately some of China’s Maoists are finding inspiration in an unlikely insurgent in the West: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump “has torn up the old rules of the ruling elites, not just of the capitalist West,” said Zhang Hongliang, a polemicist who is the loudest proponent of what could be loosely called “Maoists for Trump. ” In a recent essay, Mr. Zhang lauded the American president as being alone among national leaders daring “to openly promote the political ideas of Chairman Mao. ” President Xi Jinping of China will be sizing up Mr. Trump during a visit to his    estate in Florida this week, in the leaders’ first summit meeting. Meanwhile, many ordinary Chinese people have also been taking the measure of the new American president and have been bewildered, incensed and yet, sometimes, inspired. The global wave of nationalist,   sentiment that Mr. Trump rode to power has washed ashore in China, encouraging a   fringe that is hostile to capitalism and Western influence, and that the Communist Party has long sought to cultivate  —   and contain. China’s Maoists are a small minority most Chinese have no desire to revive the ruthless, convulsive politics of the Mao era. But the Maoists’ growing assertiveness, echoed in their embrace of aspects of Mr. Trump’s agenda, could help push the country in a more authoritarian direction. They also complicate the efforts of  Mr. Xi to play both sides of an ideological divide: as a robust defender of Mao’s legacy, but also a proponent of market liberalization and even a champion of globalization in the Trump age. It is a paradox that these admirers of Mao Zedong, a Marxist revolutionary who railed against Western imperialism, have found things to like about this American president, a property tycoon with a cabinet crowded with millionaires. But they want Mr. Xi to take a page from Mr. Trump’s “America First” script and protect Chinese workers from layoffs, privatization and foreign competition. “Trump opposes globalization, and so should China,” said one article on Utopia, a popular Maoist website. “Trump’s ideology has oriented toward China, and he is learning from China,” said another   Chinese site. China’s   as they are sometimes called, are loosely united by demands for stringent economic equality, zealous nationalism and a loathing of the capitalist West and liberal democracy. “Many of the same ideas now animating the global populist movement have been the hallmarks of the   movement for over a decade,” said Jude Blanchette, a researcher in Beijing who is writing a book about the movement. “The   have also clearly benefited from the rise of Xi Jinping, as he has blasted a pretty large dog whistle in their direction,” Mr. Blanchette added. Many on China’s far left see Mr. Trump as a dangerous foe who has questioned established American policy on Taiwan, vowed to confront China’s hold on the disputed South China Sea and threatened to cut Chinese exports to America. But some Maoists say Mr. Trump also offers a model. They think he led a populist revolt that humbled a corrupt political establishment not unlike what they see in China. They cheer his incendiary tactics, sometimes likening them to Mao’s methods. And they hear in his remarks an echo of their own disgust with Western democracy, American interventionism and liberal political values. Maoist meetings and websites dwell on a clutch of enemies, including the C. I. A. and America in general, genetically modified crops and advocates of privatizing state companies. But they reserve a particular venom for liberal Chinese intellectuals and celebrities who have condemned Mao. In the West, Mr. Zhang argued, the nationalists are on the right while the left generally supports internationalism. “But China is the opposite,” he said. “Chinese rightists are the traitors, while Chinese leftists are the patriots. ” The Communist Party never repudiated Mao’s legacy after his death in 1976, but it condemned his excesses, including the violent Cultural Revolution, and for years he was ignored or discredited while Deng Xiaoping pursued economic liberalization. In the 1990s, though, the party refurbished Mao’s image and fostered a popular revival to bolster its authority and blunt calls for political liberalization. Officials started using Maoists to intimidate liberal academics, dissidents and other critics. Before Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, a political rival, Bo Xilai, openly encouraged “red” nostalgia for the Mao era as part of an effort to build a populist power base. Mr. Bo was purged in a scandal, but the Maoists regrouped as Mr. Xi associated himself more closely with Mao’s legacy than his predecessors and called for a return to Marxist purity. Under Mr. Xi, Maoists have become bolder in taking to the streets and organizing online campaigns. A court ruling last year and legislation adopted last month protecting Communist heroes buoyed them further. Nobody expects Maoists to seize power in Beijing. They are disdained by the middle class and kept on a tether by the party authorities. Across China, there are maybe a few thousand active supporters of Maoist groups and causes, and their petitions against liberal intellectuals have gathered tens of thousands of signatures online, according to Mr. Blanchette, the researcher. But the Chinese left’s broader message of muscular nationalism and its criticism of widening inequality have reverberated, especially among retirees,   workers and former party officials dismayed by extravagant wealth and corruption. Mr. Trump and the global surge of nationalism and populism have added to the political tinder. Dai Jianzhong, a sociologist in Beijing, said Maoists could gain a bigger following if an economic slowdown caused mass layoffs, or if tensions with the United States escalated into confrontation. “It was a big shock for China to see American   society overwhelmed by this tide of populism,” Mr. Dai said. “China is a different society, but if the economy stagnates and workers feel badly let down, populism will gain influence. The influence of Maoists and ultraleftists would spread. ” In January, about a hundred protesters gathered in Jinan, a provincial capital in eastern China, to condemn a professor of communications and advertising, Deng Xiangchao, who had dared criticize Mao online. They chanted and held banners near Mr. Deng’s home, reviling him as a “traitor” and “enemy of the people,” and roughed up a few people who came to show their support for him. “We love Chairman Mao because we’re poor, and the poor all love Chairman Mao,” Yang Jianguo, a retired worker who was among the protesters, said by telephone after the protest. The university swiftly dismissed Mr. Deng rather than engage in a prolonged battle with the Maoists. Later,   activists also successfully demanded the dismissal of a television station worker who had voiced support for Mr. Deng. It would be unthinkable for the party to be so obliging of protesters for free speech or other causes the party considers anathema. But while Mr. Xi has silenced the party’s liberal critics, the party has tolerated, even abetted, its   opponents, giving the Maoist populists room to grow stronger. “Their influence has clearly grown with the leftist turn in ideology, especially since 2015,” said Deng Yuwen, a current affairs writer in Beijing who has criticized the Maoists. “It’s not that the top level of the party directly controls them, but the Maoists are politically astute, and they have a good sense of what they can get away with,” he added. “They know the officials use them, but they also use the officials. ” While party leaders may find them useful for intimidating critics, the Maoists want to take China in a different direction and reverse market policies that have fueled decades of growth, by seizing the assets of the rich and strengthening state ownership of industry, for example. Most phrase their criticism of the party carefully, but some openly accuse it of betraying Mao. “China is a capitalist state under socialist guise,” said Mr. Yang, the retired worker. “Capitalists dominate the country. ” Asked about the American president, Mr. Yang was more generous: “Trump has socialist tendencies, because the way he won power in a way reflected the workers’ demands. ” Many Maoists see Mr. Xi as a fellow traveler who is taking China in the right direction by restoring respect for Mao and Marx. But others say privately that even Mr. Xi may not be a dependable ally. They point out that he has promoted himself abroad as a proponent of expanding global trade and a friend of multinational corporations, drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump. He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who is often reviled by China’s far left, said Mr. Xi was playing a dangerous game by allowing Maoist populists to silence liberal voices and risked igniting political fires that he cannot easily control. “If political currents in China increasingly converge with populism,” Mr. He added, “that would have a powerful effect on China’s future. ”	0	BEIJING   —    protest , picket sing defend Mao memory , yearning East red . lately China Maoists finding inspiration unlikely insurgent West : Donald J.

15785	17953	Speaker Ryan’s Obamacare-Lite Plan Primer - Breitbart	Sean Moran	Speaker Ryan’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare elicits calls of “ ” in some quarters. [Here are some of the larger reforms in the Ryan’s American Health Care Act:  Individual Mandate, Under Obamacare, individuals are required to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. The Ryan plan replaces the individual mandate penalty with a penalty payable to the health insurance companies. Individuals who forgo health insurance for longer than 63 days face a 30 percent surcharge on their health insurance premiums. Since premiums are based on age, older Americans face a more expensive penalty for forgoing health insurance. The Ryan mandate’s penalty is based on age, not on income, so   Americans could be subject to a disproportionately higher penalty than wealthier Americans. Employer Mandate, Obamacare required that employers with 50 or more   employees must provide health insurance to their employees and their dependents. The American Health Care Act repeals the employer mandate. Taxes on ‘Cadillac’   Health Plans, The Affordable Care Act taxed expensive health care plans provided by employers at 40 percent. Rather than repealing the Cadillac tax, Speaker Ryan’s plan delays the Cadillac tax until 2025. Repeal of Various Taxes, Paul Ryan’s plan would repeal taxes on: Refundable Tax Credits  The American Health Care Act creates refundable tax credits for individuals to purchase health insurance. The tax credits are adjusted by age: These credits are available for those making $75, 000 or those who file jointly at $150, 000, and the credit phases out by $100 for every $1, 000 higher in income in these age brackets. Raises Limits on Contributions to Health Savings Accounts, Health Savings Accounts allow individuals and families to pay for out of pocket costs medical costs. The American Health Care Act raises the annual contribution limit to $6, 550 or $13, 100 for family coverage. Essential Health Benefits, Paul Ryan’s Obamacare replacement retains Obamacare’s essential health benefits. The essential health benefits provisions requires that insurers maintain a minimum level of coverage, including emergency services, prescription drugs, laboratory services, vision, and dental. State Innovation Funds, The Ryan plan creates a $100 billion “Patient and State Stability Fund” that creates subsidies for states to provide care to   individuals, stabilize private insurance premiums, promote aces to preventive services, and provide cost sharing subsidies. Medicaid Expansion Reform, Medicaid expansion will be capped per capita in 2020.

2248	2577	James Mattis, Outspoken Retired Marine, Is Trump’s Choice as Defense Secretary - The New York Times	Michael R. Gordon and Eric Schmitt	WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump said on Thursday he had chosen James N. Mattis, a   retired general who led a Marine division to Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, to serve as his secretary of defense. Mr. Trump made the announcement at a rally in Cincinnati, calling General Mattis “the closest thing we have to Gen. George Patton. ” General Mattis, 66, led the United States Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, from 2010 to 2013. His tour there was cut short by the Obama administration, which believed he was too hawkish on Iran. But his insistence that Iran is the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East, as well as his acerbic criticism of the Obama administration’s initial efforts to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, made him an attractive choice for the incoming president. After retiring from the military, General Mattis told Congress that the administration’s “policy of disengagement in the Middle East” had contributed to the rise of extremism in the region. The United States, he told lawmakers in 2015, needs to “come out from our reactive crouch and take a firm, strategic stance in defense of our values. ” But in some important policy areas, General Mattis differs from Mr. Trump, who has been filling the top ranks of his national security team with  . General Mattis believes, for instance, that Mr. Trump’s conciliatory statements toward Russia are ill informed. General Mattis views with alarm Moscow’s expansionist or bellicose policies in Syria, Ukraine and the Baltics. And he has told the   that torture does not work. Despite his tough stance on Iran, General Mattis also thinks that tearing up the Iran nuclear deal would hurt the United States, and he favors working closely with allies to strictly enforce its terms. After Mr. Trump met with General Mattis at Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey on Nov. 19, the   said on Twitter that he was “very impressive” and “a true general’s general. ” On Thursday, Mr. Trump surprised the Cincinnati crowd with the announcement, saying: “I gave up a little secret. ” He added that he would formally announce General Mattis’s appointment on Monday. General Mattis, whose radio call sign during the invasion of Iraq was Chaos  —   reflecting the havoc he sought to rain on adversaries  —   has been involved in some of the United States’   operations. As a   general, he led the first Marine force into Afghanistan a month after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and established Forward Operating Base Rhino near Kandahar. At times, General Mattis’s salty language has gotten him into trouble. “You go into Afghanistan, you got guys that slap women around for five years because they didn’t wear a veil,” he said in 2005. “So it’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. ” But the retired general, a lifelong bachelor who has said that he does not own a television and has often been referred to as a “warrior monk,” is also famous for his extensive collection of books on military history. “Thanks to my reading, I have never been caught   by any situation,” he wrote a colleague in 2003. “It doesn’t give me all the answers, but it lights what is often a dark path ahead. ” General Mattis would be the first former ranking general to assume the post of defense secretary since George Marshall in  . He would need a special congressional waiver to serve as defense secretary. He retired from the Marines in 2013, and federal law stipulates that the Pentagon chief be out of uniform for seven years. But he has strong support in Congress, especially from John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In a recent phone call, Mr. McCain urged Mr. Trump to consider appointing General Mattis or Gen. Jack Keane, a retired Army vice chief of staff, as defense secretary. But General Keane has decided against returning to government in a   capacity. Mr. McCain said in a statement that General Mattis was “without a doubt one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops. ” He added, “America will be fortunate to have General Mattis in its service once again. ” But Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and also a member of the Armed Services Committee, said that while she respected General Mattis’s service, she would oppose a waiver to allow him to serve. “Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy,” she said in a statement. The selection of General Mattis is a boost for the Marines. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be working with Joseph F. Dunford, the   Marine general who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It would also create an unusual situation at the Pentagon because the new defense secretary would be General Dunford’s former commanding officer. During the Iraq invasion, General Dunford was a colonel who led a Marine regiment that reported to General Mattis. General Mattis led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. He later commanded American troops during the   battle to retake Falluja from Sunni insurgents in 2004. As head of the Central Command, General Mattis was heavily involved in plans to counter Iran’s military and protect the sea lanes in the Persian Gulf. William Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard and a staunch opponent of Mr. Trump’s, sought to persuade General Mattis to mount an independent presidential bid. And he was courted by both the campaigns of Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton to speak at the political conventions, but declined. In a new book, “Warriors and Citizens,” which General Mattis edited with Kori Schake, a Hoover Institution fellow who served in the George W. Bush administration, he complained that politicians had relied too much on military commanders to make the case for their policies. “President Bush left to Gen. David Petraeus the task of overcoming congressional opposition to the 2006 Iraq surge,” General Mattis and Ms. Schake wrote. “President Obama has been mostly silent on the war in Afghanistan since 2009 the case for continuing American troop presence has been made entirely by the military. ” Military commanders, they wrote, have a responsibility to carry out and advocate the president’s policies. “This does not remove elected officials from the responsibility to win political arguments instead of depending on the military to do so,” they added.	0	WASHINGTON   —      Donald J.

18275	20790	Nikki Haley Blasts U.N. Human Rights Office for ‘Unfair Bias’ Against Israel in Latest Report	Adam Shaw	U. S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has blasted a new U. N. report that attacks Israeli actions in the Middle East, in what she says is the latest sign of the U. N.’s “unfair bias” in how it handles the   conflict. [The report, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was submitted in response to a resolution by the Human Rights Council  —   a body which Haley has repeatedly criticized for its own   bias and the questionable human rights record of some of its members.  The report, titled, “Ensuring accountability and justice for all violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,” evaluates Israel’s compliance with a number of U. N. resolutions and reports, including demands to deconstruct its security barrier on the West Bank, which has been credited with massively reducing terrorist attacks. The report adds: The High Commissioner notes the repeated failure to comply with the calls for accountability made by the entire human rights system and urges Israel to conduct prompt, impartial and independent investigations of all alleged violations of international human rights law and all allegations of international crimes. Furthermore, the High Commissioner calls upon Israel to ensure that all victims have access to remedies and reparation. The report also notes previous recommendations, including an   boycott call for “investigations of the activities of companies and financial institutions profiting from Israeli settlements, and for such practices to be ended and for reparation to be provided to Palestinians affected. ” Haley took issue with the report’s focus on Israel, noting that it “brushed over” terror attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups attacking Israel, and ignored the human rights abuses of other countries. “This report is just the latest example of the Human Rights Council singling out Israel rather than focusing on the world’s actual human rights abusers,” she said in a statement. “Not only does it undermine the credibility of the Human Rights Council on human rights issues, but it once again highlights the unfair bias of the UN when it comes to the   conflict,” she said. Haley also took issue with the recommendation that the U. N. General Assembly ask the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on Israel, something her office says is out of the purview of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Israel’s Ambassador to the U. N. Danny Danon also condemned the report, saying, “This obsession with Israel has crossed all lines. ” Danon accused the office of offering to “advise and support” efforts to create what he called a “blacklist” database of companies working in the region so that the international community could threaten a boycott. The latest report comes a week after Haley visited the Human Rights Council’s headquarters in Geneva and warned that the U. S. could leave the council if it didn’t reform its voting and bias against America’s ally in the Middle East. The same week, Breitbart News reported on an upcoming report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia and submitted in the name of Secretary General Antonio Guterres, blaming Israeli settlements for a host of Palestinian grievances for everything from excessive use of force to building parks in the West Bank so as to “entrench” Israel’s presence.

1712	1971	U.S. Open Quieted Those Calling for a Roof. Now It Faces a Louder Problem. - The New York Times	David Waldstein and Ben Rothenberg	The United States Open added a new $150 million retractable roof before this year’s tournament, so fans inside Arthur Ashe Stadium no longer need umbrellas. They might, however, need earplugs. Fans at the U. S. T. A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows have long been more raucous than those at the sport’s usually staid tournaments. But the retractable roof structure has produced new and unforeseen noise issues: Voices of fans in the upper reaches of Arthur Ashe Stadium, the showcase for the Open’s marquee matches, are reverberating off the roof and can be heard loudly and clearly down on the court during play. The U. S. Open trailed behind the Australian Open and Wimbledon in adding retractable roofs to allow play to continue during rain, long a disrupter of tennis. The rain stays out now, but the noise stays in  —   creating an echo chamber and a much louder experience for everyone. “Ladies and gentlemen, please, your voices are carrying to the court,” the chair umpire Eva   told the crowd Thursday night in one of her many pleas for silence.   has had to tamp down the noise at Ashe before. During last year’s men’s final, she deftly managed a rowdy   Federer crowd that had turned on his opponent, Novak Djokovic, the eventual champion. But during the first week of the tournament this year,   and other umpires have needed to manage even   matches with repeated requests for silence and stillness. Even those announcements  —   and player interviews before and after matches  —   have been difficult to hear. The tournament that once rerouted air traffic from La Guardia Airport to create a more pastoral soundscape now has flawed acoustics. Even with the roof open, the structure still has enough reflective surface to generate cascading waves of sound. “I didn’t feel silence at any moment,” Garbiñe Muguruza said after her   loss with the roof open. “It was continuously a noise. I think it’s very big, this stadium, also. It’s kind of echo. It’s just like continuously. ” Putting a cover on top of Ashe Stadium was an architectural and engineering challenge because the stadium sits on marshy land. But after years of deflecting pressure to build a roof that would prevent the almost inevitable rain delays, the United States Tennis Association relented. But the solution to one problem has made another one more acute. With a capacity of 23, 771, Ashe Stadium can hold nearly 9, 000 more people than two other showcase courts with retractable roofs: Centre Court at Wimbledon and Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open. And the concretelike hardcourts at the U. S. Open only magnify the problem. At most stadium sporting events, loudness is welcome, or even encouraged. At basketball arenas, football stadiums and baseball parks, video boards frequently implore, “Let’s make some noise!” In tennis, cheering is acceptable after points, but fans are expected to be quiet in the moments leading up to the action and the time during play. Fan behavior at Ashe Stadium has always been unusual when compared with the three other Grand Slam tournaments  —   the Australian Open, the French Open and Wimbledon. At the hallowed ground of Centre Court at Wimbledon, talking aloud during a point would probably get fans ejected. Francesca Castelli, a brand manager from London, said the music inside Ashe seemed louder than last year, perhaps because of the roof. But she blamed noisy fans more than the roof for the cacophony during points. “When play is on, it’s on,” she said, “so just shut up. It’s disrespectful to the players. But I suppose when it rains, everyone will be happy that the roof is there. ” But in the upper reaches of cavernous Ashe Stadium, fans never had to worry about their chatter affecting the play on the court. It is not unusual for fans to talk on cellphones in the middle of a match without getting shushed. There is an added dimension to the din that is unique to the Open among Grand Slam tournaments: the 90 luxury suites that circle the stadium. Their occupants, who often include celebrities and guests at corporate events, are often more interested in partying than    and the owners of the suites pay top dollar. That most of the matches in Ashe Stadium, while   have been routs may also have driven fans to distraction. Daniel Heischrek, a Swiss sports reporter, said he enjoyed the noisy atmosphere and even felt comfortable making a cellphone call during a match. “I think it’s part of the U. S. Open,” he said. “It’s New York. I mean, New York without noise wouldn’t be New York. It’s not Zurich, you know?” The increased noise presents a challenge to the television broadcaster ESPN, which employs software to learn, detect and even remove the din of sustained noises like the air ventilation system. But crowd noise is less predictable. “You want to get the blend of what the crowd influence might be, but not to the detriment of what the package is,” said an ESPN vice president, Jamie Reynolds. U. S. T. A. officials say it is too early to call the noise a problem. Gordon Smith, the U. S. T. A.’s executive director, said that the players and the fans would have to adjust to the new conditions, and that although many players have commented on the noise levels, few have outwardly complained. “The noise level in Ashe will be a discussion point after the 2016 tournament, for sure,” said Chris Widmaier, a spokesman for the U. S. T. A. “We will gather all the data and address what, if anything, needs to be done. ” Indeed, by Friday night, there were signs that fans may have already been sufficiently chastened by the umpires’ rebukes. The sound level was not quite as troublesome during Rafael Nadal’s   victory over Andrey Kuznetsov,       though there were moments when Nadal paused for the din to subside. John Storyk, an architect and acoustician who helped build Jimi Hendrix’s Electric Lady Studio in Manhattan in 1969, is an expert on noise control in venues large and small. His company, Walter Storyk Design Group, helped fashion the acoustic atmosphere at three venues at the Rio Olympics, including the Maracanã stadium. He said there were steps that could still be taken to dampen or absorb sound. “We’ve made a fortune fixing restaurants,” he said. “They don’t pay attention to it until someone complains. When someone complains, they call us. ” He has not seen the new roof and stressed that he did not know the specifics of the situation. But in general, he said, the first step would be to take measurements of what is happening when the roof is open and when it is closed, with people inside the stadium and when it is empty. “Once you have the data, then comes the art,” he said. “You have to determine how much absorptive material and where to put it. ”	0	United States Open added new $ 150 million retractable roof year tournament , fans inside Arthur Ashe Stadium longer need umbrellas . , , need earplugs .

9317	10616	Putin — Who Once Honored Tillerson with Friendship Award — Won’t Meet with Secretary of State - Breitbart	Penny Starr	The U. S. and Russia have been trading barbs since President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on the Assad regime’s military assets in Syria last week, but now Russian President Vladimir Putin has closed the door on a    meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when the U. S. top diplomat visits the country later this week. [Russia has long supported Syrian President Bashar Assad and refutes the U. S. claim that the dictator ordered the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed innocent people, including many children.  “We have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president’s diary,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a Monday press conference call, according to Reuters. Before Tillerson became Secretary of State, he was the CEO of ExxonMobil, a job that included dealings with the Kremlin. In 2013, Putin presented Tillerson with the Russian Order of Friendship award. Tillerson is expected to meet with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during his stop in Moscow, according to Reuters. Reuters reported that Putin regularly met with John Kerry, Secretary of State under Barack Obama. “Reacting to media reports that Tillerson would use his visit to press Moscow to stop supporting Syrian President Bashar   Russia’s closet Middle East ally, Peskov called that a ” Reuters reported. “Returning to   to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out,” Peskov said. Other thorny issues may surface during Tillerson’s visit to Moscow, including Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 U. S. presidential election, its violation of an arms control treaty, and finding common ground on fighting radical Islamic terrorism in Syria. Tillerson had some tough words for Russia on Thursday about the chemical weapons attack. Speaking from Trump’s    estate in Florida, where Trump was meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tillerson cited Russia’s 2013 agreement to oversee the destruction of Syria’s chemical stockpile, saying Russia has “clearly failed in its responsibility” to eliminate those weapons. “Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,” Tillerson said. U. S. military officials have said they are certain Assad is responsible for the attack. “We highly suspect, and in fact, there’s no credible alternative to a Syrian regime air attack as the source of the chemicals that killed so many Syrian civilians,” a military official said. “ISIS has experimented with mustard agents, blister agents, not nerve agents,” an official said. “But this is well beyond the technical capability of the opposition. ”	0	U.
